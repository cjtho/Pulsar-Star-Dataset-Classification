# Machine Learning for Pulsar Star Prediction

## Project Goal
This project aims to predict Pulsar stars using various machine learning classifiers, showcasing the power of ML in astrophysics. The focus is on evaluating multiple classifiers, optimising the best one using grid search, and applying the model to test data.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset for this project includes characteristics of Pulsar stars and is sourced from Kaggle: [Predicting Pulsar Star](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/colearninglounge/predicting-pulsar-starintermediate). It features measurements like mean integrated profile, standard deviation of the DM-SNR curve, and excess kurtosis of the integrated profile.

## Code Structure
- `PulsarClassifierComparativeAnalysis.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook for testing five different classifiers, evaluating their performance, and optimising the best model using grid search.
- `pulsar_data.csv`: The dataset file used in this project. Split into training with seen and testing with unseen data.

## Usage
Begin by exploring `ClassifierComparativeAnalysis.ipynb` to understand the workflow, from data preprocessing to model evaluation. Ensure the `pulsar_data.csv` files are in the working directory. 

## Future Work
Experiment with more advanced machine learning techniques to improve classification accuracy.
